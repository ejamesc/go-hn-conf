# Go Hacker News Confidence

This project grabs Hacker News, sorts them according to the lower bound of a Wilson score confidence interval for a Bernoulli parameter, and spits it out as HTML. We assume points as upvotes and comments as downvotes. 

## Slightly longer explanation
This project is how I weaned myself off Hacker News. I've found that the most
worthwhile HN articles to read are ones with high upvote to comment ratio.
Controversial articles tend waste time e.g. "Why Rails sucks"; high-quality analysis and
world-changing news generates little conversation but much upvoting.

This saves everyone some time.
